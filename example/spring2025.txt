Simply paste or stream any type of raw data—text, chat, audio, video, or LLM outputs—and we'll instantly generate a tailored annotation interface, clear guidelines, and an automated human-in-the-loop workflow.  Our AI Judges quickly learn from human annotations, take over labeling for easy cases, and evaluate live production data, letting your team focus only on critical edge cases.

Key differentiators
1. Instant custom UI - Automatically generate tailored annotation interfaces just by uploading your data. Adjust easily whenever data or needs change.
2. Tailored guidelines – Import any existing guidelines or we will draft new ones aligned with your business goals, ready for annotation
3. AI Judges for real-time evaluation – AI-powered judges continuously improve by learning human preferences, automatically labeling data and flagging tough cases for expert review.
4. Enterprise-grade deployment – On-prem optional install, and robust user management for internal SMEs, external vendors, or Besimple’s vetted annotators.
5. Lightning-Fast Setup: No code, no plugins—just drop in your data, set guidelines, and you’re good to go.

Today we power evaluation and training pipelines for leading AI companies in customer support, search, education, and more.  For example, the leading AI grading company Edexia uses besimple to annotate hundreds of decisions and improve their evals.

Besimple is built by a team that has done this before. Yi Zhong and Bill Wang built the annotation platform for Meta’s Llama models, significantly improving quality of data and shortening model development cycle.

Reach out!

If you’re building an AI product and struggle with good eval or training data —or if you have models in prod with no idea why they fail—let’s talk. We’ll show you how to launch a custom annotation flow in a minute, bootstrap an AI Judge in an afternoon, and start shipping better models tomorrow.

69. Ticket Wallet
Title: AI-optimized ticket resale
Description: Ticket Wallet is an AI-powered resale platform for season ticket holders and brokers.
We automate pricing, listing, and distribution across all major marketplaces.

Today, most tickets are still sold manually: spreadsheets, guessing prices, and listing on one site at a time. The biggest brokers outsource pricing to teams in the Philippines… 

We built Ticket Wallet because we lived this. Truman has been flipping tickets for the last 5 years. Ryan built pricing software after seeing the mess first-hand. We’ve turned that pain into a product.

Since launch, we’ve onboarded $3M+ in ticket inventory, signed up 100+ paying sellers, and started working with pro teams. We charge 10% per ticket sold. This is our wedge into the $26B resale market.

URL: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/clidey

73. Opusense AI
Title: AI for Field Inspection Reports
Description: Opusense AI automates field report writing for construction field inspectors. Instead of typing up notes at the end of the day, inspectors can now walk a site, speak observations aloud, snap photos, and let our AI assistant generate a detailed, organized report on-site and in real time.

Combined, the founding team has over 15 years in the construction industry. Writing up these field reports used to take up at least 20% of the week. With Opusense, we cut that time by 5x. Our team combines deep construction experience with technical expertise, Roya has a PhD in civil engineering, and Michael has worked at multiple construction tech startups.

Why hasn’t this been done before? Construction is slow to adopt new tech, and reporting is messy, photos, voice notes, and field notes all live in silos. Turning that into a clear, structured report requires real insight into how inspectors work and what clients need. Only now, with advances in AI, can we process unstructured data adequately to generate high-quality reports in real time.

The opportunity is massive. Every inspection firm and contractor is struggling with documentation. Manual reports slow them down, create inconsistencies, and delay handoffs. We believe AI can do this better, and Opusense is proving it.

84. Tinfoil
Title: Tinfoil makes your AI workflows secure, verifiable, and private.
Description: Tinfoil makes it easy to make your AI workloads provably private, without changing your code. You get the privacy of on-prem deployments, while running on the cloud.

We’ve built a full-stack platform on top of the latest NVIDIA GPUs offering confidential computing capabilities, meaning that you don’t have to tradeoff performance for privacy. 

Under the hood, we integrate a suite of recent advances in secure hardware technologies, in particular NVIDIA’s confidential compute mode available on Hopper and Blackwell. When combined with Tinfoil’s software stack, companies can prove their security claims rather than relying on unenforceable statements like "trust us, we don’t log your queries.” Tinfoil guarantees that all data always stays private and cannot be accessed by anyone other than the end user — not even by Tinfoil or the cloud provider it’s processed on. 

The founding team combines deep academic and industry experience in security and internet protocols. Tanya was previously a systems engineer at Cloudflare, where she built Internet security protocols used by billions, and contributed to the Workers AI platform. Jules and Sacha recently completed their PhDs at MIT where they worked on secure hardware and privacy-preserving technologies. Jules has also worked at NVIDIA on their confidential computing team. Nate has deep infrastructure experience, starting in high school when he built a mini-CDN that got him an internship at Cloudflare. Tinfoil was born from our personal frustration with the false choice between access to powerful AI and data privacy.

As AI becomes tightly integrated into our lives and business workflows, it will touch an ever increasing amount of sensitive personal and proprietary data. Right now, the only solutions are DPAs, band-aids like PII redaction, or the nuclear option of running everything on-prem. These solutions are not scalable.  By making it easy to deploy provable privacy, Tinfoil promises to unlock significantly deeper AI adoption and integrations, just as TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish by securing credit cards on the network.

If OpenAI is creating “God in a box”, we are putting God in a blackbox, so Satan can’t spy.

90. Kestral
Title: AI Agents that prioritize the highest impact work across Sales and R&D
Description: Kestral makes it clear what your customers want most, prioritizes those tasks for highest leverage, and closes the loop with those customers.

We (Brian and Bernard) have been close friends since university, and most recently worked together at Asana, leading AI and Authorization efforts. There we realized AI can completely disrupt the $50B Work Management Market, but it required a fresh start.

What work we even choose to manage in the first place is critical, and the most important insights from customers are silo-ed in sales/CS while R&D gives their best shot at roadmaps meant to deliver impact. Significant requests sit in a backlog, duplicate asks flood the system, months wasted on "strategic investments". We want to bridge this gap.

This message is resonating with heads of sales, heads of product, CEOs, as well as individuals, all trying to make sure the most important things get done, with less wasted effort and more revenue/retention.

Kestral works by automatically take in customer data like sales call transcripts & feature request messages and a team of agents:
1. analyze them for actionable takeaways, deal blockers, and nice to haves
2. consolidate them and manage all the asks with citations
3. prioritize them by impact and frequency to cut through the noise so you can see the biggest opportunities clearly
4. connect them to your existing strategic roadmap so when the work gets done, we can automatically follow back up with your customers and win them over

This is just step one of our mission to revolutionize how work gets done -- starting with what we choose to work on, and hope you follow us along for the ride!

91. Attune
Title: Faster builds, zero effort.
Description: Attune makes blazingly fast build tools that require zero migration effort.

As AI enables developers to write code faster than ever, slow builds are increasingly becoming the bottleneck in development velocity. Developers regularly lose hours of productivity every day waiting for their builds. Imagine being able to write code in 1 minute, but needing to wait 30 minutes to compile, deploy, and test it.

Existing solutions either require painful migrations to new tools (e.g. Bazel) or rely on just using bigger servers to run your builds. Instead, we do native, first-class integrations into compilers and build systems.

With Attune, you don't need to integrate a new tool. Just make a one-line change from `cargo build` to `hurry cargo build` for 20x faster builds.

Eliza (ex-Google) and Xin worked together for 3 years at FOSSA, where Eliza was Head of Engineering and Xin was Head of Product. Eliza brings a decade of programming languages and build systems expertise, while Xin brings a decade of experience building developer tools products, most recently as VP of Product at Teleport (S15). Having experienced the pain of slow builds firsthand across hundreds of production codebases, we're building the solution we've always wanted.

92. PgDog
Title: Scaling engine for PostgreSQL
Description: PgDog is an application for sharding PostgreSQL. It understands SQL and can distribute queries automatically between databases. It's built for managed databases, like AWS RDS, and doesn't require any changes to application code or schema.

In addition to sharding, PgDog is a load balancer and pooler, so it can act as a replacement for PgBouncer, RDS Proxy, and other Postgres scaling products. It brings the simplicity and performance of HTTP load balancing to the database.

Built from the experience of sharding Postgres at Instacart during peak growth in 2020, PgDog is the answer to the old question: does Postgres scale? It does now.

96. Percival
Title: AI-powered data entry for wholesalers and distributors
Description: Percival helps wholesalers and distributors automate data entry by using AI to process documents like purchase orders and price lists. 

When wholesalers and distributors sell to other businesses, they often receive purchase orders as PDFs over email. Customers frequently use different identifiers for items, different units, and close but not quite the same descriptors. Employees aren't just copy-pasting (or manually typing) PDF data into an ERP, they have to validate every item in the ERP.

With Percival, businesses can just email customer POs and other requests to a dedicated @percivaltech.com email address. Once the request is handled, Percival responds to the email with the result: whether that's an order number in the ERP or a list of prices.
URL: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/percival

97. VibeGrade
Title: Cursor for Teachers
Description: VibeGrade is the AI that works directly inside Google Classroom, Google Docs, and Canvas to grade papers 10x faster, in the teacher's style. 

Teachers often spend hours of their own time grading hundreds of papers, which can lead to rushed and generic feedback for students.

110. Claim Health
Title: The first AI revenue platform for post-acute healthcare
Description: Post-acute agencies lose up to 15% of revenue each year to denials, non-compliant documentation, and delayed payments. Most treat it as a cost of doing business. Instead of waiting weeks for rejections and appealing claims one by one, Claim Health flags issues in real-time and automates claim corrections and appeals—before revenue is lost.

While working with healthcare providers, we found most denials stem from small, preventable documentation errors. As payor requirements grow increasingly complex and fragmented, billing has become a manual, error-prone process. Claim Health closes the loop between documentation and billing outcomes—using AI to detect issues, automate workflows, and recover thousands in missed revenue each week.

Kevin and JJ bring nearly a decade of experience building and scaling healthtech companies. At Dandy, JJ was a founding engineer and Kevin was the first GTM hire; together they helped grow the business from 0 to $150M+ ARR. At Perry (now Jolly), JJ led engineering and Kevin was Head of Sales, driving the company through a $16.5M Series A led by Tesla’s former CFO.

In under three weeks since incorporation, we've launched with three agencies and are in early discussions with large U.S. health systems.

Post-acute care is a $400B market with over $20B in annual revenue leakage due to broken billing workflows. Claim Health is fixing that—starting with denials, and expanding into the full revenue cycle stack.

And connecting dozens of those tools directly to your systems introduces significant security vulnerabilities and maintenance challenges.

Capacitive offers a better way: connect us once to where your data lives, then create secure data gateways with granular cross-platform permissions, comprehensive monitoring, and robust security filtering. Supercharge tools like Cursor with product and team-level context — or use those access points via our built-in AI chat system, where your team can navigate your organization's knowledge and perform actions across platforms in one place.

116. Galen AI
Title: Personal AI healthcare agent, powered by clinical and wearable data.
Description: Galen is an AI-powered personal healthcare companion. We enable patients to securely connect their medical records from over 800 healthcare institutions across more than 12,000 locations in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. We also connect with over 20 popular wearable devices including Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Dexcom, bringing all your medical records and health data into one unified space. 

We founded Galen because for over four years, Viraj struggled to navigate several conditions related to chronic low back pain. He often found himself waiting weeks for responses from his care team, received little guidance or education about new diagnoses, and was overwhelmed trying to manage overlapping conditions and medications.

His experiences are not unique. Our healthcare system is overloaded and fragmented, and often, patients are left to navigate their care on their own. Everyday there are nearly 1 billion health-related Google searches, but the responses to such queries are generic and impersonalized, because the searches lack any insight into a users personal health background.

By leveraging your own data and state-of-the art LLM memory capabilities, Galen delivers personalized insights, proactive health recommendations, and 24/7 on-demand medical support — empowering patients to be an active part of their health team. We are a consumer app in beta testing and will be available on the App Store soon!

124. cubic
Title: AI-powered code review platform
Description: Code review is a major bottleneck for software teams, and the rise of AI-generated code is making the problem worse. Reviewing large volumes of code slows devs down, and increases the chances of bugs slipping through.

That's why we're building cubic: an intelligent code review platform that helps devs merge PRs 28% faster.

How? 
- When you open a PR, cubic automatically reviews it. It learns from your codebase's patterns, points out bugs, suggesting fixes, and frees you from low-level review tasks.
- You then jump into the cubic platform, which is designed to optimize how humans review code. For example, file changes are organized in a logical order instead of alphabetical, and cubic generates diagrams of architecture changes.

129. Vybe
Title: Lovable for internal apps
Description: We're 2 repeat YC founders. We founded Plato (W16, sold to Coda) and Wolfia (S22). Quang lead Product/GTM for Coda Solutions and Fabien is ex-SWE at Meta and lead Engineering at Wealthfront before.

We’re building Vybe: "Lovable for internal apps". We come with pre-built building blocks: Integrations (Gmail, Gcal, Github, Jira, etc.), SSO and AI tools (Websearch, Summarization etc.) so anyone in a company can build and launch internal AI-powered apps.

Vibe coding is dramatically lowering the barrier for non-technical users to create full web apps. Lovable, Replit, Bolt, Google, Canva, Figma all launched their vibe-coding platforms. People love them. They're great for prototyping, but it's difficult to roll out inside a company for internal use cases for those reasons: 

1. Data: If you want to connect your existing data (e.g. Salesforce, Gmail, Jira), you'd need to rebuild the API auth, pagination, etc. 

2. SSO: If you build 20 apps, you'll have 20 different logins

3. Security: AI-built apps have massive risk of exposing data, especially if built by non developers

So companies are stuck in the old world: clunky spreadsheets, rigid SaaS solutions or complex no-code tools.

Time to build!
